First commit 8:05:
establish my own git repository for project clone

10:17:
Still working on first AJAX functionality.  Seem to have the process working and not failing but not refreshing the text or input field yet.



E-commerce site. Uses `bcrypt` and `materialize`. There's a seed file. Set up your own admin. If you have questions, I'll be in Bali with no email. Ask someone else.

To set up:

* `rake db:setup`

* Sorry, didn't get around to tests. It mostly works. There might be a few bugs.
