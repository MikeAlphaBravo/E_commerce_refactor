First commit 8:05:
establish my own git repository for project clone

10:17:
Still working on first AJAX functionality.  Seem to have the process working and not failing but not refreshing the text or input field yet.

13:55:
Moved onto second AJAX functionality to test .rb.erb functionality, then realized that the commented out code in cart total update was what was erroring on the rails side in console.
Updated and added input clear as well.







### Original programmer notes:

E-commerce site. Uses `bcrypt` and `materialize`. There's a seed file. Set up your own admin. If you have questions, I'll be in Bali with no email. Ask someone else.

To set up:

* `rake db:setup`

* Sorry, didn't get around to tests. It mostly works. There might be a few bugs.
